# Sending Data From Arduino To NodeMCU

This short example shows how you can easing send different types of data from Arduino to NodeMCU via a json object. [SoftwareSerial](https://docs.arduino.cc/learn/built-in-libraries/software-serial) and [ArduinoJson5](https://arduinojson.org/) was used in the example. **ArduinoJson6 does not have the same syntax and if used it will throw an error.** If you want to upgrade to ArduinoJson6 check out this documentation [Migrate from v5 to v6](https://arduinojson.org/v6/doc/upgrade/).
